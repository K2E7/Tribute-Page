            that are used when the true name of the person is unknown.</span><br><br>Here's a 
            brief history of John and Jane Doe:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The first use of John Doe has been documented under the rule of 
            England's King Edward III as early as the mid fourteenth century.
          </li>
          <li>Other names like John Bloggs or John Smith have sometimes been informally used
            as placeholders for an everyman in UK, Australia, New Zealand.
          </li>
          <li>The landmark 1973 abortion cases Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton get their names
            from anonymous plaintiffs later revealed to be, respectively, Norma McCorvey and
            Sandra Cano.
          </li>
          <li>A Toronto woman, publicly known only as Jane Doe, waged an 11-year court battle
            against the Toronto Police Service after being raped in 1986, alleging that the 
            police had used her as bait to catch the Balcony Rapist. She won the case in 1998,
            and was named Chatelaine's Woman of the Year that year. She published a book about
            her experience, The Story of Jane Doe: A Book about Rape, in 2003.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Doe subpoena is an investigatory tool that a plaintiff may use to seek the 
            identity of an unknown defendant. Doe subpoenas are often served on online 
            service providers and ISPs to obtain the identity of the author of an anonymous post.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serial killer Richard Laurence Marquette confessed to the murder of an unknown woman
            identified only as Jane Doe.
          </li>
          <li>
            On 29 August 2011, Reliance Entertainment procured a 'John Doe' order from the Delhi
            High Court to prevent the illegal broadcast or streaming of its upcoming film Bodyguard.
            This order gives protection to the intellectual property owner, Reliance Entertainment,
            from copyright violation by prospective anonymous offenders
          </li>
          <li>
            On 10 March 2015, HTG Capital Partners LLC filed a federal lawsuit against unnamed 
            "spoofers", whom the suit referred to as John Doe(s), in the hopes of getting a judge to
            force the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to reveal the names of the firms. HTG said it had 
            found evidence of thousands of such manipulations over 2013 and 2014. 
          </li>
          <li>
            In October 2017, an unidentified minor Jane Doe detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs
            Enforcement sued to enjoin the government from obstructing her access to abortion in 
            Garza v. Hargan.
          </li>
          <li>
            In March 2021, Justice Molloy of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice named a mass 
            murderer, who was seeking notoriety, as John Doe when reading a highly publicized court 
            decision (R. v. Minassian, 2021 ONSC 1258).
